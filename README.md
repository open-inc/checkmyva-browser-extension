# CheckMyVA Browser Erweiterung

## Development

You need nodejs (tested with v14) and yarn (v1) installed.

Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Watch the code and trigger a reload in browsers (works better with Chrome):

```
yarn watch
```

Create a production build:

```
yarn build
```
